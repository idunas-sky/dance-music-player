# Dance-Music-Player
Android music player app, designed to play dance music

## Features
* Manage different playlists and add songs stored on the android device
* Play songs from a playlist
* Make a song play slower or faster
* Loop a song
* Loop between two positions in a song
* Add bookmarks for specific positions in a song and easily jump to them

## Planned
One of the next things will include an [english translation](https://github.com/idunas-sky/dance-music-player/issues/1) as the app is currently only available in german.

Check the [issues](https://github.com/idunas-sky/dance-music-player/issues) of this project to see what is planned and please use the comments or emojis to support the features you would like to see next. Or even add new features! :)

## Motivation
I'm trying to help all dancers out there to train a specific song or specific parts of a song and focus on the training itself instead of spending time controlling the music. The app is free and open-source, no ads, no catches. I'm looking forward to your feedback!
