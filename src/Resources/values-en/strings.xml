        Hey!\n
        \nI\'m passionate about dancing and I struggled to find an app having the features I need for
        my training.
        \nTherefore I created this app in my spare time. It is open-source, so if you are a developer 
        or you are interested supporting the development, please reach out to me!
        \n
        \nMany thanks to Nadja, who convinced me to start dancing as a sport even though I didn\'t want to ;)
        And many thanks to all the great dancers and trainers at TSG Backnang, with whom dancing is so much fun.
        I wouldn\'t have stayed without you!
        \n
        \nI appreciate any rating, feedback, questions, wishes and suggestions. Please reach out to me personally
        or use https://github.com/idunas-sky/dance-music-player/issues
        \n

       \n-----------------------------------------------------------
       \n
       \nPREAMBLE
       \nThe goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
       \ndevelopment of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
       \nefforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
       \nopen framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
       \nwith others.
       \n
       \nThe OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
       \nredistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

       \nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
       \nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
       \nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
       \nrequirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
       \nto any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
       \n
